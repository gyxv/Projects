## Running the simulator

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to <http://localhost:3000/brute-force> to view the React UI.

A minimal `index.html` at the project root redirects to the simulator, while the original static implementation has been preserved under `archive/index.html` for reference.
